# Desktop Scryfall Search

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This tool is my first attempt at building a GUI Python application. 

It parses the Scryfall API and does a fuzzy search for any Magic: The Gathering card.

## How to Run
You'll need to install a few things before this will run: 

```python
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install requests
```

## Known Issues
Currently, the flip button does ***NOT*** function fully. However, it works to flip dual sided cards.
